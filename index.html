                <p>Based on the process of web development, a web developer is a programmer that creates web-based
                    applications to be accessed through the Internet. These websites and apps have specific features and
                    functions that the dev is responsible to build through his programming skills.</p>

                <p>For those interested in a career in development, there are many aspects to consider. Firstly, you
                    need a
                    passion for writing code. The web moves fast, and it will be a big part of your job to move with it.
                    You’ll have to learn new languages and get your hands on new tools as time goes by.

                    To succeed in computer science, problem-solving skills are a must, as well as logical, rational
                    thinking. Patience and ability to keep your head cold are also two things that will help you a lot
                    in
                    your future job.</p>
